Dear User, 

this email informs you that your relation to the group "<b>%group%</b>" with the currently entered roles "<b>%roles(formated)%</b>" has expired. The entry in W5Base System will be removed in 4 weeks. 
Please note that the org. group relations are predefined in the HR administration system. This can be a result of a reorganization or a change of the team, etc..

It can happen that:

   * you are already assigned to a new group with the same role

   * you can no longer use certain functions or that 
     data records are no longer visible to you.

It cannot happen that:

   * your access to the system will be deleted.

What should you do:

   * Please check your group relations for plausibility 
     under MyW5Base-&gt;User Settings (Block Group Memberships) 
     or use the link at the bottom of this email marked 
     with "Show current group relations:".

   * If the relation is correct, there is no further to-do for you.

   * If the relation is not correct:
      - and you have the role "employee, member" for the group, 
        please contact your team leader, your 
        local HR bussiness partner to maintain this in 
        the HR administration system.

      - For groups with other roles, contact 1st level support.

   * If you can no longer use certain functions after 
     the group is removed, contact 1st level support.

   * If your organizational relation has been changed, please 
     make sure that all necessary entries in Config Management 
     have been update by the Databoss.
